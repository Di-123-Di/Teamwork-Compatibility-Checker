Backend: Python with FastAPI

Python is ideal for AI/ML integration, with excellent libraries for NLP and data processing (scikit-learn, NLTK, spaCy, etc.)
FastAPI is specifically mentioned in your tech stack and offers:

High performance (comparable to Node.js)
Automatic API documentation
Data validation
Asynchronous request handling
Simple integration with ML models



Frontend: React.js

React.js (as specified in your document) provides:

Component-based architecture for building interactive dashboards
Efficient DOM updates for responsive visualizations
Extensive ecosystem of UI libraries for charts and data visualization
Good integration options with visualization libraries like Google Charts API

Database: SQL/NoSQL

For structured data with clear relationships (candidates, teams, questionnaires), PostgreSQL would work well
